to empower our react application we needed a packages who can give the super to y application

todo : by add react to your app it doesnot make the app faster we needed a tons of helper function
! we have minified your code

If we wanted to install any pacakages . we needed to have package manager with us

package.json contains all the dependinces packages which our file needed
package-lock.json contains which exact versions we have to install or our project needed

command npm init

command
dependencies - i needed that packages in prod and developer machine also
 npm install packages-name   npm i packagename

devdendenccies - i needed that packages in developer machinee


to install the parcel npm i -save-dev packkage-name


any packages y will installed it files will present in  nodemodules

anything that can regenmerated by own that will put on the gitignore


parcel doesnot remove the console.log

we have confiq the babelrc file to clear console

browserlist help us to make our code compactaiable to older version of browser also


createElement takes three parameter 
1. Element
2. attribute in terms of obj
3. content of the element

in craeteRoot we have pass the root of your dom

using render method we injected our code to that specific root 

if the code is already present inside the root our react will overide that all code


our js doesnot know what is im[port and export. we have tell that it not a noramal js files

it module file to specifies it we have type=module

we can create the shortcut also command

hmr - hot module replacement is the process which uses file wtcher algorithm to tarck our files

polyfill -> a code which is just replecement of new version code

suppose our browser doesnot support array.map then i will create my own array.map whcih will behave same as the array.map

does we have write polyfill no 

babel do it jobs

babel is the transcomplier which takes next generation js code and complied it to browser compactiable code


jsx - jqvascript xml

every tag y opend should be closed

jsx is not html inside js

jsx is the html like syntax.

react.createElement => object => html(dom)

jsx => react.createElement => object => html(dom)


{} in jsx we have write your jhs experssion within thhe curly braces


if we have to write multipline line jsx we have use ()
jsx expression should contain only one parent


everything in react an itself a sepearte component

1. functional component - we use the approcah
2. class component

functional component nothing but the js function only which return some species of jsx
this component are reuses in the entire file

the functional component should be always in pascal case the first letter should be capital

one tag is called => jsx element

an expression => conatins of group of jsx element
